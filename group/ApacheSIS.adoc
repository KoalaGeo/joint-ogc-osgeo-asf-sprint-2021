=== Work item proposals

* Review OGC filter implementations, together with a review of corresponding GeoAPI interfaces.
* Review the https://github.com/apache/sis/tree/master/storage/sis-shapefile/src/main/java/org/apache/sis/storage/shapefile[Shapefile reader]. May need to redevelop some parts.
* JavaFX widget for Coordinate Reference System definitions.
* Help migrating the https://sis.apache.org/[web site] to a new (to be determined) Content Management System and take this opportunity for making it better.
